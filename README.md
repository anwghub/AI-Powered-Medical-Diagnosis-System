### Project Title
AI-Powered Disease Prediction Tool

---

### Overview of the AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis System
This system uses AI to help doctors diagnose diseases faster and more accurately. By applying machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM), it can analyze a wide variety of medical data—everything from symptoms and test results to medical images. The best part? It’s all wrapped up in an easy-to-use Streamlit web app, making it super simple for users to input data and get real-time diagnostic insights.

### Why It's Important

- **Improved Accuracy**: Reduces human error and identifies patterns that are difficult for doctors to spot.
- **Faster Decision-Making**: Quick predictions help doctors make informed decisions, crucial in critical situations.
- **Accessibility**: Makes diagnostic tools available in underserved areas with limited medical resources.
- **Personalized Treatment**: Tailors treatment plans based on patient data.
- **Cost-Effective**: Minimizes unnecessary tests and streamlines the diagnostic process, reducing costs.
